## Purpose

    App provides people the ability to use a movie poster to get a 
    random genre list generated which will then pick a playlist that will allow them to listen to 
    that music at their leisure and they will be able to take different types of music based on the movie that they choose.
  
## Organization of app

    When an individual clicks on the submit button it takes the movie that they selected and generates the poster for that movie. 
    When someone clicks on the poster it will randomly choose a genre for that movie which then will randomly generate a playlist. 
    For the randomization of this choice it is generated based on math.random. 
    Based on this the user is able to then listen to music with an I-frame that is, 
    generated through spotify which allows the user to listen to the desired playlist.
